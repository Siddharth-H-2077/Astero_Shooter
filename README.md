Movement-Hold Left Click and Drag Mouse. (touch inputs were used but the build I pushed was a web desktop one.) 
Scoring- 10 per hit landed on the asteroids.
Player has only 1 Life he dies if he hits an asteroid.

In level 1 there are 2 enemies:-
the Samll one takes 1 hit to die (Small one).
the Large one takes 2 hits to break down and die.

In level 2 and 3,2 new more enemies appear,a golden one that drops a coins and a green one that drops a special double bullet for player:-
->both drop items after 2 hits.
if the player gets power up he remains in the power up state till the end of the level.
getting power up again has no property.

If player finishes level 1 they get a screen of them winning then and on click they proceed to level 2 and so on.

In total 3 levels are made the first one is easy to survive but in the further levels it becomes more and more difficult.

All the assets were made in photoshop except for the background.
