# Astero_Shooter
A simple 2D Space shooter game Made with Cocos 3.8.1

Screen Resolution: 640X960
Movement-Hold Left Click and Drag Mouse. (touch inputs were used but the build I pushed was a web desktop one.) 
Scoring- 10 per hit landed on the asteroids.
The Player has to Achieve a target Score Mentioned in each level's beginning to finish the level.
Player has only 1 Life he dies if he hits an asteroid.

In the start scene the player will have to click on the word "Click start", to start the game. 

In level 1 there are 2 enemies:-
the Samll one takes 1 hit to die.
the Large one takes 2 hits to break down and die.

In level 2 and 3,2 new more enemies appear,a golden one that drops a coins and a green one that drops a special double bullet for player. The new enemies, both drop items after 2 hits.
If the player gets power up he remains in the power up state till the end of the level.
Getting power up if the player already has it, does not affect anything.

If player finishes level 1 they get a screen of them winning then and on click they proceed to level 2 and so on.
If player loses then he's sent back to the Start Screen.

In total 3 levels are made the first one is easy to survive but in the further levels it becomes more and more difficult.

All the assets were made in photoshop except for the background.
