Movement-Hold Left Click and Drag Mouse. (touch inputs were used but the build I pushed was a web desktop one.) 
Scoring- 10 per hit landed on the asteroids.
Player has only 1 Life he dies if he hits an asteroid.

In level 1 there are 2 enemies:-
-> 1 that takes 1 hit to die (Small one).
->the other that takes 2 hits to break down and die (Large one).
In level 2 there are 2 more enemies appear, 1 who drops coins and 1 that drops special double bullet for player:-
->both drop items after 2 hits.
If player finishes level 1 they get a screen of them winning then and on click they proceed to level 2 and so on.

All the assets were made in photoshop except for the background.
